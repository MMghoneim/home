		 <h1> Overview </h1>
               <p> This page will cover the DMC4SE Vergil has a relatively small moveset, however his moves are quite powerful and versatile, his tech is quite complex and demands plenty of muscle memory to do consistently, managing concentration meter is also important but we will cover that later.  Information from  <a href="https://youtu.be/UF16RaBq9V4">here</a>.  
             
		 <h1> Mechanics </h1>
       <p> Vergil's concentration meter <img src=“/img/concentrationgaugearrowbetter.jpg”> is Vergil's main mechanic in DMC4, it increases when vergil walks or stands still, or preforms perfect judgement cuts, it decreases when vergil takes damage or misses attacks. When the concentration meter is full, Vergil's attacks increase in power, in particular, Yamato's attack reach increases, Beowulf attacks gain a 4th charge level, and Mirage blade attacks hit multiple times.<img src="concentrationgaugearrowbetter.png" width="290px" height="180px"/>
		 <h1> Weapons </h1>
                 <h1> Beowulf, Mirage Edge </h1> 
                    <p><img src="beowulfdmc4.png" width="90px" height="90px"/> Beowulf is Vergil's heavy close quarters weapon, a pair of light gauntlets and boots, they lack range but make up for it with speed and power with their attacks, most Beowulf attacks can be charged on three levels, when Beowulf is equipped, Vergil's jump becomes a quick attack, not dealing much damage but it can stagger enemies so it's a good choice to use when surrounded by enemies.
					<p> <p><img src="vergilmirageedge.png" width="90px" height="90px"/>Mirage Edge is Vergil's 2nd weapon, a balance of quick attacks with decent range, Mirage Edge doesn't have too many moves,  but they are decently useful and have their place in Vergil's kit, High time is a good launcher and Drive and Over Drive can be very powerful when used correctly. </p>
					<p> Mirage Blades, Vergil's ranged weapon, they are meant to be used in tandem with his other weapons, so there isn't too much to write here, however it is important to note that Vergil can teleport to Enemies with Mirage Blades embedded into them, and Mirage Blades can stun weak enemies. </p>
					<p><img src="vergilyamato.png" width="90px" height="90px"/> Yamato, the cream of the crop of Vergil's arsenal, boasting the one and only Judgement Cut, Judgement Cut is easily Vergil's best move, it is preformed by holding the attack button with Yamato equipped, Yamato will flash and a barrage of slashes will appear in front of Vergil when the attack button is released, you can preform a Perfect Judgement Cut by releasing the attack button as soon as Yamato flashes. this Judgement Cut will do increased damage, have less recovery time, and even build some Concentration Gauge.
